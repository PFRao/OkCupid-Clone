FresherNote is a full-stack web application inspired by Evernote.  It utilizes Ruby on Rails on the backend, a PostgreSQL database, and React.js with a Flux architectural framework on the frontend.  

## Features & Implementation

 **NB**: don't copy and paste any of this.  Many folks will implement similar features, and many employers will see the READMEs of a lot of a/A grads.  You must write in a way that distinguishes your README from that of other students', but use this as a guide for what topics to cover.  

### Single-Page App

FresherNote is truly a single-page; all content is delivered on one static page.  The root page listens to a `SessionStore` and renders content based on a call to `SessionStore.currentUser()`.  Sensitive information is kept out of the frontend of the app by making an API call to `SessionsController#get_user`.

```ruby
class Api::SessionsController < ApplicationController
    def get_user
      if current_user
        render :current_user
      else
        render json: errors.full_messages
      end
    end
 end
  ```

### Note Rendering and Editing

  On the database side, the notes are stored in one table in the database, which contains columns for `id`, `user_id`, `content`, and `updated_at`.  Upon login, an API call is made to the database which joins the user table and the note table on `user_id` and filters by the current user's `id`.  These notes are held in the `NoteStore` until the user's session is destroyed.  

  Notes are rendered in two different components: the `CondensedNote` components, which show the title and first few words of the note content, and the `ExpandedNote` components, which are editable and show all note text.  The `NoteIndex` renders all of the `CondensedNote`s as subcomponents, as well as one `ExpandedNote` component, which renders based on `NoteStore.selectedNote()`. The UI of the `NoteIndex` is taken directly from Evernote for a professional, clean look:

Note editing is implemented using the Quill.js library, allowing for a Word-processor-like user experience.

### Notebooks

Implementing Notebooks started with a notebook table in the database.  The `Notebook` table contains two columns: `title` and `id`.  Additionally, a `notebook_id` column was added to the `Note` table.  

The React component structure for notebooks mirrored that of notes: the `NotebookIndex` component renders a list of `CondensedNotebook`s as subcomponents, along with one `ExpandedNotebook`, kept track of by `NotebookStore.selectedNotebook()`.  

`NotebookIndex` render method:

```javascript
render: function () {
  return ({this.state.notebooks.map(function (notebook) {
    return <CondensedNotebook notebook={notebook} />
  }
  <ExpandedNotebook notebook={this.state.selectedNotebook} />)
}
```

### Tags

As with notebooks, tags are stored in the database through a `tag` table and a join table.  The `tag` table contains the columns `id` and `tag_name`.  The `tagged_notes` table is the associated join table, which contains three columns: `id`, `tag_id`, and `note_id`.  

Tags are maintained on the frontend in the `TagStore`.  Because creating, editing, and destroying notes can potentially affect `Tag` objects, the `NoteIndex` and the `NotebookIndex` both listen to the `TagStore`.  It was not necessary to create a `Tag` component, as tags are simply rendered as part of the individual `Note` components.

## Future Directions for the Project

In addition to the features already implemented, I plan to continue work on this project.  The next steps for FresherNote are outlined below.

### Search

Searching notes is a standard feature of Evernote.  I plan to utilize the Fuse.js library to create a fuzzy search of notes and notebooks.  This search will look go through tags, note titles, notebook titles, and note content.  

### Direct Messaging

Although this is less essential functionality, I also plan to implement messaging between FresherNote users.  To do this, I will use WebRTC so that notifications of messages happens seamlessly.
