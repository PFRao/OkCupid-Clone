- [ ] The minimally necessary features for an Evernote-inspired site: note creation and saving, note editing, and notes organized into notebooks
- [ ] Hosting on Heroku
- [ ] CSS styling that is satisfactorily visually appealing
- [ ] A production README, replacing this README (**NB**: check out the [sample production README](https://github.com/appacademy/sample-project-proposal/blob/master/docs/production_readme.md) -- you'll write this later)

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Backend setup and User Authentication (0.5 days)

**Objective:** Functioning rails project with Authentication

the API.

- [ ] create `Note` model
- [ ] seed the database with a small amount of test data
- [ ] CRUD API for notes (`NotesController`)

user interface.

- [ ] setup the flux loop with skeleton files
- [ ] setup React Router
- implement each note component, building out the flux loop as needed.
  - [ ] `NotesIndex`
  - [ ] `NoteIndexItem`
